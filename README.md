# Oblique – Modular AV Synthesizer

Oblique is a Python‑orchestrated, Shadertoy‑style engine for real‑time, audio‑reactive
visuals.  It targets artists who want to pair live music with live visuals and includes
bindings for external devices such as Elektron gear.

## How it Works

Oblique follows a simple flow: **Input → Processing → AV Modules → Output**

- **Input** – Audio files, live audio, MIDI, OSC, or time signals
- **Processing** – Feature extraction, normalization and event detection
- **AV Modules** – Fragment‑shader based visual units
- **Output** – Real‑time composition rendered to the screen

### AV Modules

Modules loosely follow the Shadertoy rendering model: a stock vertex shader drives a
full‑screen quad while the fragment shader contains the creative logic.  Modules may
optionally use ping‑pong buffers for feedback and additional off‑screen passes for
intermediate compositing.

### Patches

Most of the magic lives in a **patch** – a small Python function that returns an
`ObliquePatch` describing the inputs and AV module to run.  Here's a tiny patch that
plays an audio file while rendering a beat‑reactive circle:

```python
from core.oblique_patch import ObliquePatch
from inputs.audio_file_input import AudioFileInput
from modules.audio_reactive.circle_echo import CircleEcho, CircleEchoParams
from processing.fft_bands import FFTBands

def circle_patch(width, height):
    audio = AudioFileInput("beat.wav")
    fft = FFTBands(audio)
    circle = CircleEcho(CircleEchoParams(width=width, height=height), fft)

    def tick(t: float):
        return circle

    return ObliquePatch(audio_output=audio, tick_callback=tick)
```

Save this as `circle_patch.py` and wire it up in your own runner or modify `main.py` to
load the patch.

## Key Features

- **One‑way state flow**: data flows downward, fully in code.
- **Audio‑reactive** analysis and feature extraction
- **Modular design** for creating new visual units
- **Hardware integration** with external devices (e.g. Elektron gear out of the box)
- **GPU‑native** GLSL rendering
- **Performance**: 60 FPS @ 1080p on Apple Silicon

## Current Limitations

- Optimised for Apple Silicon with Metal‑backed OpenGL
- Requires GLSL **330 core** shaders
- No cross‑platform support at the moment

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
./install.sh

# Run with demo audio
./start.sh

# Or run manually
python main.py --audio "path/to/audio.wav" --width 800 --height 600 --audio "path_to_audio"
```


## Testing

This project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for unit testing.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

Run with `pytest --cov` to measure test coverage.

## 🔊 Audio Input

We use the system microphone (or audio interface) via `sounddevice` to:
- Capture audio in real time, potentially from a file
- Perform FFT analysis
- Send normalized bands and envelope to the processing layer

---

## 🧩 Modules

Modules are:
- Self-contained Python classes inheriting from `BaseAVModule`
- Linked to a GLSL shader for rendering, where shaders are needed for perf.
- Driven by processed signals from the processing layer
- Easy to test independently

### Shader Loader & Includes

Shaders are preprocessed before compilation using a lightweight loader that resolves
`#include` directives. Includes can point to other files in `shaders/` using
`#include "path/to/file.glsl"` or pull from the vendored [LYGIA](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia)
library via `#include <lygia/path/to/file.glsl>`. This enables modular, reusable GLSL code
across modules.


## 🤖 AI Agent Development

Oblique is designed to support AI-assisted and AI-authored development.

Modules and engine components follow simple, well-documented conventions that allow AI agents to:
- Generate new visual modules from template code
- Compose audio-reactive behaviors without deep engine knowledge
- Run, test, and swap modules programmatically

We optimize for:
- Predictable structure (one Python + one GLSL file per module)
- Clean metadata and parameter exposure
- Stateless components when possible
- Minimal dependencies and isolated functionality

Future goals include:
- AI-generated scenes and compositions
- Automatic module tuning from reference music or MIDI
- Generative documentation and mutation of existing patches

## Inputs

Inputs are modular sources of data for Oblique. All input classes inherit from `BaseInput` (in `/inputs/base_input.py`), which defines a simple interface: `start()`, `stop()`, and `read()`.

### Example: AudioDeviceInput

`AudioDeviceInput` reads audio from a file and provides it in chunks for processing and visualization. It is useful for prototyping and testing audio-reactive modules.

```python
from inputs.audio.core.audio_device_input import AudioDeviceInput
input_device = AudioDeviceInput("path/to/audio.wav", chunk_size=2048)
input_device.start()
chunk = input_device.read()
input_device.stop()
```

Future input modules will support live audio, MIDI, OSC, and more.

## ⏱️ Transport and Sync

Oblique now includes an internal clock that tracks tempo, phase and musical
position. Bridges let the clock sync via Ableton Link or an incoming MIDI clock
so external gear and DAWs stay in phase.

All transport sources expose ``state()`` returning a ``ClockState`` dataclass
with tempo, bar, beat and phase information.

Run the demo patch to view the transport in action. Use ``--link`` for Link
sync or ``--midi PORT`` to follow a MIDI clock:

```bash
python projects/demo/transport_demo.py --link
python projects/demo/transport_demo.py --midi "Elektron Digitakt"
```

On two laptops connected to the same network the tempo and phase will stay
synchronized; changing the tempo on one propagates to the other.

Ableton Link and MIDI support require the ``abletonlink`` and ``mido`` packages
respectively, with a backend such as ``python-rtmidi`` for MIDI.
